                    <p><b class="text-warning">Origin of the potato or 'Chunu'</b> 
                        The potato originated from southern Peru and was much smaller back then. The first potatoes were grown high in the Andes (South America) from the second century of our era by the Incas. High in the mountains no other plants could grow except for chunu (the potato), so it became popular. The various types of chunu's were eaten fresh as staple food by the Incas, but also dried to flour and even processed into beer. All these chunu's, or 'early potatoes', are derived from one plant from the south of Peru, as shown later by a DNA test.
                        <b class="text-warning">Potato recognized as food</b> 
                        Yet it took a long time before the potato in was recognized as food in Europe. In the beginning, the potato was mainly planted in the botanical gardens just for it's looks. The stems and berries of the potato plant are poisonous and therefore the farmers in Europe thought that the tubers were unhealthy as well. At that time potatoes were mainly used as food for pigs or very poor people. In 1727 the potato had it's big moment. It was finally accepted as food in the Netherlands. Slowly but surely the potato gained popularity and got very popular. From the 18th century, the potato was grown in every European country and has since become more and more popular..</p>
