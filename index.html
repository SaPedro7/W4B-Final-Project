        <h3>Madarin Orange Cream Popsicles</h3><br>

        <p>With two young kids, I love finding and making healthy snack foods because it seems like they are always hungry! Fresh fruit is always an easy go to snack and we all love Wonderful Halos because not only are they easy for the kids to serve and peel themselves, but they are so sweet and juicy. I love having a bowl of them on our kitchen table that the kids can grab whenever they are hungry. As a special treat, I will even turn a few into mandarin cream popsicles with granola. My kids love them because they think they are getting a special naturally sweet treat (especially when I let them eat them for breakfast), and I love them because they are a simple and healthy snack. Weâ€™ve teamed up with Wonderful Halos mandarins to share the recipe for these mandarin orange cream popsicles that are good for breakfast, snacks, or as a slightly sweet after dinner treat.</p>

        <h3>Rainbow Popsicle</h3><br><br>
        <a href="https://easyandhealthyrecipes.com/mind-blowing-popsicles-for-summer/" target="_blank"><img src="img/pop1.jfif" alt="" height="250px" width="300px"></a>
        <p>Along with ice cream, colorful and flavorful popsicles (or ice pops) are the perfect choice to cool you down from the heat of summer. They are a piece of water or milk-based ice flavoured with fruit and served on a stick. Unlike ice cream or sorbet, which are whipped while freezing to prevent ice crystal formation, an ice pop is frozen while at rest and becomes a solid block of ice. Ready to give them a try?</p>

        <h3>Blueberry & Orange Popsicle</h3><br>
        <a href="https://healthyparentsandkids.blogspot.com/2010/05/blueberry-orange-popsicles.html" target="_blank"><img src="img/pop2.jfif" alt="" height="250px" width="300px"></a>
        <p>I'm sure you've all noticed how freakin' hot it's been all week (I think we've had record highs and I love it!) and unfortunately our pool isn't open yet (if you could see me now, you' see my sad face). We're having problems with the plumbing and might need to dig it all up and repair it, which will take a while. Just ask Dave how he feels about having a pool and he'll gladly tell you how much he despises it, more than he despises car alarms (he really hates car alarms). So, without a pool to cool off in, my family has been searching for other ways. The best, most delicious way? Blueberry Orange Popsicles! My kids love Astro Smooth and Fruity Blueberry yogurt, like really, we go through a couple tubs a week, so I thought it would be fun to freeze it. Blueberries are full of antioxidants and vitamins, orange juice is full of vitamin C, and yogurt has calcium. It's the perfect, fun way to enjoy a healthy frozen treat!</p>
